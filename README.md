Hello everyone! I have no idea how you've stumbled upon this project of mine, but it's the first project
that I'm confident enough to push to github! I've made this with the help of Jonas so huge credits to him.

This is a website that I built (designed by Jonas Schmedtmann) using only SASS and HTML. No javascript!
I find this project to be very aesthetically pleasing so it was a really fun experience building it.

There's no complex architecture, simple .scss files divided by webpage sections, a base file, and obviously
a main file. There's a package.json so make sure to install the node_modules.

Oh and I pushed it to netlify: realestatedemoproject.netlify.app :D
